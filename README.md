# DM Loading ... #

Got inspiration from http://github.com/gerusz/dm_loading_screen to make this. 
This is much simpler than that one.

## When to use this? ##

Use this when you (the DM) are busy thinking of something. Give the players a loading screen!

To run it open up the directory with an HTTP server. If you have python3 installed it is quite easy:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Run that in your terminal with this directory as the cwd. Then just navigate to http://[::]:8000/ on your web browser.


If you need help, feel free to ask :)
